# Chrysomallos Discord Bot

## Introduction
Chrysomallos is a simple and customizable Discord bot built using `discord.py`. This bot provides a basic template for creating a bot that can respond to commands, send messages, and interact with users.
I will add new features to this project later when I have time.

## Features
- Responds to basic commands like `!hello`, `!goodmorning`, and `!sheep`.
- Handles command errors gracefully.
-Easy to extend with new commands and functionality (for example, chatbot, global weather, alarm).

## Prerequisites 
- `discord.py` library
- Discord bot - Python 3.7 or higher (I am using Python 3.12)
- token

I will later add a function that will install all the dependencies.

- In development (old bot: Karakul)
